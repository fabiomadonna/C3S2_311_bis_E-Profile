# Data License for E-PROFILE and Aggregated Wind Datasets

## 1. Dataset Types

1. **High temporal resolution data** collected directly from the E-PROFILE network.  
2. **Aggregated datasets** produced from E-PROFILE data at hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly resolutions, provided via the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).

## 2. License Terms

### 2.1 E-PROFILE Raw Data

- **Members:** EUMETNET members can use the data for official duties and core tasks (e.g., volcanic ash detection).  
- **Third parties:** Use is allowed for research and education under a standard EUMETNET license, requiring co-authorship.  
- **Commercial use:** Strictly prohibited.  

**Reference:**  
> The EUMETNET E-PROFILE data policy allows members to use the data for official duties and core tasks, and third parties to use it for research and education under a standard EUMETNET license agreement, which requires co-authorship. Commercial exploitation is not permitted. Data is publicly visible on the E-PROFILE website, though access can be restricted if necessary.

### 2.2 Aggregated Datasets (CDS)

- Derived from E-PROFILE measurements (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly aggregates).  
- Provided through Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).  
- **License:** Subject to the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) / Copernicus User License.  
- Users must comply with Copernicus terms, which generally allow research, educational, and operational use but may impose attribution requirements.  
- Commercial exploitation is governed by CDS license terms.

## 3. Data Visibility and Access

- **E-PROFILE raw data:** Publicly visible, restricted access possible.  
- **Aggregated CDS datasets:** Accessible through Copernicus platforms; access may require registration or account.  

## 4. Data Management

- **Data exchange:** E-PROFILE raw data is exchanged using the E-PROFILE filename convention. Aggregated datasets follow Copernicus metadata standards.  
- **Quality control:** All datasets undergo monitoring, reporting, and calibration.  
- **Attribution:** Users must cite data correctly according to the source: E-PROFILE for raw data, Copernicus for aggregated datasets.

**Important Note:**  
High-resolution raw data remains under EUMETNET E-PROFILE license. Aggregated datasets offered via CDS are only subject to the Copernicus license.
