E-PROFILE WIND PROFILER — EXTENDED USER GUIDE WITH WORKFLOW SCHEMES
1. INTRODUCTION
This document provides an extended and betternstructured explanation of the EnPROFILE wind
profiler
processing workflow, integrating the official guide with a detailed analysis of the script
“After_optimizing_eprofile.R”. It also includes conceptual workflow schemes to clarify the data
pipeline.
2. OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESSING PIPELINE
The processing workflow performs: metadata extraction ® raw data extraction and filtering ®
cleaning ® computation of wind metrics ® multiple aggregation levels (hourly/daily/monthly/yearly)
®
NetCDF export per station and height level.
3. WORKFLOW SCHEME (TEXT DIAGRAM)
RAW CSV FILES
¯ Metadata extraction (parallel)
¯ Data extraction: read ® parse ® filter blocks ® unify
¯ Filtering step (implausible values, QC)
¯ Compute wind variables:
- wind speed
- wind direction
- wind power density
- turbulence intensity
- wind stress
¯ Aggregation:
® hourly
® daily (24-hour completeness check)
® monthly
® yearly
¯ Normalize time fields
¯ NetCDF export (station × height × period)
¯ Logs saved
4. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF MAIN SCRIPT SECTIONS
4.1 Package loading
The script automatically installs and loads all required packages, ensuring portability.
4.2 Metadata extraction
Each CSV may contain one or more header blocks. The system reads them in parallel and
produces a
metadata summary table grouped by station.
4.3 File processing
Each file is scanned to identify “data” blocks. Within each block:
- station and date_valid fields are extracted
- the block is parsed via data.table::fread
- variables X1, X4, X6, X7 are retained
- X4 is filtered for quality control
- logs count retained vs removed observations
4.4 Parallel extraction
Files are split into batches and computed with foreach/doParallel.
A global filtered dataset is produced and sorted.
4.5 Cleaning and physical variable computation
Wind speed = sqrt(u² + v²)
Wind direction = atan2(u, v)
Wind power density = ½ · r · U³
Turbine flags (cut-in, cut-out limits) are added.
4.6 Filtering steps
The script logs the impact of each filtering step at each height and station.
4.7 Aggregation workflow
– Hourly: statistical summaries including SD, turbulence intensity, wind run
– Daily: requires 24 hourly values
– Monthly: averages and extrema on daily values
– Yearly: averages and extrema on monthly values
4.8 NetCDF export
For each period (hourly/daily/monthly/yearly) and station:
- Long-format conversion
- Creation of NetCDF variables (values, timestamps, heights)
- Addition of metadata and CF-compliant attributes
5. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
• Keep metadata Excel file updated to avoid missing attributes in NetCDF.
• Prefer HPC clusters for >10 GB datasets.
• Ensure date formats are consistent.
6. FINAL NOTES
This extended document is designed to serve as the complete reference for both operational and
scientific
usage of the E-PROFILE wind profiler workflow.
